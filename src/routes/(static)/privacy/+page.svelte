	<h2 class="text-xl">Mysterious Third-Party Partners</h2>
	<p>
		In our quest to enhance the enchantment of our Service, we may collaborate with mystical
		third-party services. These sorcerers of technology might gather information about your mystical
		journey with us. However, fear not, as their intentions are honorable, and they are bound by
		magical contracts not to use your information for nefarious purposes. We encourage you to
		explore the secret scrolls containing the privacy policies of these mystical allies:

		<li>Google Play Services</li>
		<li>Firebase Analytics</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="text-xl">Data Collection and Usage</h2>
	<p>
		To offer you an unparalleled experience, we may request certain personally identifiable
		information, such as your favorite color, the name of your childhood pet, or your preferred
		pizza topping. Rest assured that we will handle this information with the utmost care, treating
		it like precious treasure. We may use this data to provide you with a personalized experience

	</p>
	<h2 class="text-xl">Cookies: The Magic Crumbs</h2>

	<p>
		We do not rely on ordinary cookies; we prefer magical crumbs to enhance our spellcasting
		abilities. These enchanted morsels contain mystical data and are transmitted to your mystical
		browser when you visit our website. They reside within the secret recesses of your device,
		imparting our Service with unique powers. You have the choice to accept or reject these magical
		crumbs, but be aware that refusing them might diminish the full extent of our enchantment.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-xl">The Protection of Secrets</h2>
	<p>
		We hold your personal information in the highest regard and take extraordinary measures to
		protect it. We employ magical safeguards, incantations, and shields woven with the finest
		cryptographic spells to ensure its safety. While we strive to achieve the highest level of
		protection, we must acknowledge that no mystical method is foolproof. Therefore, we cannot
		guarantee the absolute security of your information, but we promise to guard it with our magical
		prowess.
	</p>

	<h2 class="text-xl">Portal to Other Worlds</h2>

	<p>
		Our enchanted Service may contain gateways to other realms and dimensions. Should you venture
		through these portals by clicking on third-party links, you will find yourself in uncharted
		territories. Please be aware that these realms are beyond our control, and their arcane
		practices and privacy incantations may differ. We recommend you review the privacy policies of
		these mystifying worlds, for we bear no responsibility for their mystical ways.
